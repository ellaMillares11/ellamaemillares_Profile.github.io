                As we enter the information age and the world’s population continue to rise, so our digital data. 
                We produced massive amounts of data in our daily life especially when using technology. According 
                to some experts, the current estimates are that more than 64 zettabytes or 64 thousand billion gigabytes 
                of digital data have been produced in the entire world, this is predicted to surpass 175 zettabytes in 2025. 
                Imagine how massive and overwhelming it is, and later this can become our biggest problem on how to store big 
                data because servers, cloud storage, hard drives, SSD, and other physical storages may fail. But, thanks to the 
                biotechnological discoveries, they conduct research and study on a promising solution for future storage and this 
                was using DNA as a data storage. So, what is DNA data storage and how it works to help the world in storing massive data?
                <p id="p2_2">
                    Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) stores important and complex data about human life and is naturally a great candidate for 
                    storing digital data. DNA data storage is an innovative technology that allows us to encode and decode data to and from 
                    strands of DNA. According to medium.com, the DNA in our bodies is made up of nucleotides that form pairs in a specific order. 
                    There are four different nucleotides in DNA: adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G), and thymine (T). DNA data storage works by 
                    encoding digital data sequences (0s and 1s) into DNA sequences (A, C, G, T). The sequenced information is then synthesized into artificial DNA. 
                    To retrieve information from this DNA, one must decode the nucleotide sequences from the artificial DNA back into binary data, which is extremely difficult.
                    Our DNA contains our genetic information which defines our heritable characteristics such as eye color, height, or blood group. So, DNA is therefore 
                    a natural data storage medium which was endured through billions of years evolution. With this knowledge, scientist generates an idea that we can store 
                    data or information in DNA molecule like photos, videos by encoding binary on the sequence letters of DNA. According to institutpasteur.com – a website 
                    for research, health and future; we could store data or information in the biological medium: through the process of encoding, writing, information storage and reading.
                    <p id="p2_2">
                        The encoding is the first step, which requires the translation of a sequence of 0s and 1s containing digital information into a sequence of 
                        As, Ts, Cs, Gs. Multiple encoding strategies are possible for example, we could encode 2 bits per letter by translating 00, 01, 10, 11 into 
                        A, C, T, and G respectively or 1 bit per letter by translating 0s into A or C and 1s into Ts or Gs. Next is writing, the DNA sequence in the form of 
                        A, T, C, G is synthesized by a series of chemical reactions. A DNA strand is formed by adding the
                        nucleotides one by one following a given sequence. Then, information storage, the
                        information is stored in the form of a DNA molecule. It can be conserved in vitro, in a tube,
                        and will remain stable for long time at ambient temperature, provided it is kept away from
                        humidity, air and light. Lastly, the reading, once stored the information must be able to be
                        accessed. This step can be done thanks to DNA sequencing, largely used in molecular
                        biology, which allows for the reading of sequence of strand of DNA. The order of the
                        letters A, T, C, and G can them be reconverted into 0s and 1s to obtain the digital
                        information. So, this is how we can store data in DNA molecule, this was studied by a
                        number of research groups that have worked upon the development and improvement of
                        methods to permit the easy manipulation of DNA sequences.
                        <p id="p2_2">
                            Now, what are the pros and cons of using the DNA data storage. First, it provides
                            high storage capacity, DNA has a huge storage capacity that a single gram of synthetic
                            DNA can hold up to 215 zettabytes (125 million gigabytes). In theory of experts, all data
                            produced in the world could be encoded in a coffee cup of DNA. It can support long lasting
                            storage, DNA can last a very long time, in any condition for ten thousands of years without
                            the need of maintenance. This makes a perfect choice for long term storage. The size of
                            DNA is extremely small and cannot be viewed by the naked eye, making it useful for
                            storing data in a confined space. Also, DNA data storage can save energy than servers
                            that has a heavy impact on the environment, this is called the green data storage. But
                            there are also cons on this DNA data storage that’s why it is still not available today. First,
                            its cost, DNA storage is new and the price is really high. The cost per megabyte for
                            encoding data is estimated $12, 400 and extra $200 is needed for retrieval / decoding.
                            Next, read and write speeds, DNA has slow read and write speeds so it is not ideal for
                            real-time storage and activities, this just work best for long term storage. It is also not
                            rewritable and no random-access functionality, once you encode data into DNA, there is
                            no way of making changes to your data without redoing the encoding process.
                            <p id="p2_2">
                                DNA data storage was really a promising technology to give solution for storing
                                massive data in the future. As our population increases, our data that need to be managed
                                was doubled the size each year. We need this advanced technology to be able to keep
                                the important data about us. As the man-power and Ai important in organizing data so as
                                the storage, and we are fortunate, grateful that we have this biotechnology advancements
                                and breakthrough. But for now, as the study of DNA based data storage still on research
                                and development, we could still benefit and use the servers or the cloud storages and
                                also save our data on our personal drives and SSDs, then wait for future data storages
                                that may be invented for storing data efficiently. I am excited to these new discoveries
                                and the new world of data. Therefore, data is everywhere and valuable, we must protect
                                and store it with a complex, secure and reliable form of data storages. <br><br><br>
