            <p id="p2">She is brave, she is strong, she is kind, she is just a simple girl who is willing to do
                everything for her love ones. Some people see her as weak, sometimes unnoticed and sometimes 
                they judged her because of her personality. But she has a big dream, a dream
                of a successful life to help his family and also the community. She loves to explore and 
                discover new things about herself and this person was me. Hi my name is Ella Mae Millares a 
                BSIT student and this is my story…<p id="p2">Since when I was a kid, I have an introvert personality. I 
                do love reading books, listening to music, create crafts and also designing. Growing up I am a silent 
                and shy type of person, I have few friends but they are my real and best friends. But then, I realized 
                that I will not grow if I will always be in my comfort zone. I learn to interact and socialize with other 
                people. At first it is not easy for me because I struggle and stutter a lot when I talk to a large crowd, 
                but I challenged myself for me to enhance my personality and social skills.
                <p id="p2">Choosing a course is a hard one and I have many options to choose. With this modern technology, that we have 
                in today’s generation I become interested with computer technology like in programming, how to create systems, 
                websites and software that can help our daily lives and task efficiently. am aiming and dreaming to be part of 
                our country’s technological development and innovations. Also, I got interested with the job of becoming a software 
                engineer, programmer, web developer, data analyst and a cyber security analyst someday. I have many options to 
                choose what path I should take, so I keep studying on those fields. That’s the reason why I choose BSIT as my course 
                in college. I learned that this is where my interest, passion and skills belong and I will do everything to learn this
                 course even though it is hard and challenging. I believe that I can achieve my goals if I will persevere and study well. 
                 These are some of the chapters about my story, I know that I still have a long journey to take and many stories to tell about my life someday.
