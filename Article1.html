                In today’s generation many technologies have been discovered and being developed, one of the most 
                popular and useful today was artificial intelligence system. Many Ai (artificial intelligence) are 
                being improved by many programmers, engineers and developer to help and make our daily lives efficient 
                and productive. One of the new and popular Ai system today was the ChatGpt an Ai chatbot auto-generative 
                system created by OpenAi for online care. The ‘Gpt’ in ChatGpt refers to “Generate Pre-training Transformer” 
                as this was trained on having massive amounts of data from the internet to be processed. It works like a human 
                brain and interact with humans in conversational way, and some people say that it is one of the powerful Ai systems 
                today. So, what are the functions, features and risks of the ChatGpt and what are my thoughts about it?
                <p id="p2_2">
                    Living in the 21st century the advancement of technology is really fast and it can have advantages and 
                    disadvantages in our daily lives. The ChatGpt is one of the new released Ai systems today. Having this technology, 
                    it provides many functions that could make our work faster. The ChatGpt can be used to create tasks like providing 
                    answers to questions, it can write essays, stories, scripts, it can generate computer code, it can help to translate 
                    text from one language to another, it can perform calculations, it can summarize a given text, it can easily generate 
                    text that summarizes data in tables and spreadsheets, it can respond like human in a conversational manner and many more.
                    This ChatGpt can be also used in business because of its intelligence tool and it can create tasks just a second and could 
                    make the operations of the business or company more efficiently. It really has many features and this kind of Ai can be more 
                    powerful than google and it can be a threat to the google company. Some experts saw that ChatGpt has a great potential and they 
                    try to improve it more, they say that this new technology is the future of Ai that can help the humanity.
                    <p id="p2_2">
                        However, on the other side of its success there are a lot of disadvantages that it could bring to the life of many people. As 
                        the ChatGpt arises and become popular it can be a threat to human intelligence. Like, this ChatGpt can create academic papers 
                        in just seconds and this is considered as cheating. If people will continue to dependent on this technology it can end human creativity.
                        Another example, the ChatGpt can generate a computer code for just seconds and it can be used in making websites, software and applications, 
                        this could affect the jobs of most programmers or developers as their job can be replaced by the ChatGpt Ai system. Some experts says that the 
                        ChatGpt can take or replaced many jobs, in technology, business and even in education because of its functions that could make the job of other 
                        people for just seconds. Also, there are security
                        concerns about this new Ai system like phishing emails, data theft, malware, botnets as
                        this technology holds a massive data such as personal details, passwords and even
                        software codes. It may also spread fake information and news that may affect humans.
                        There are many disadvantages on this ChatGpt that people must know and we must be
                        concern about it. Many developers and experts are still working on this new Ai system to
                        reduce its effect and to make it a more powerful tool.
                        <p id="p2_2">
                            Therefore, what is my thoughts and reaction about this new Ai system the
                            ChatGpt? For me, this new technology is an achievement to humans because of its ability
                            to help our tasks and work efficiently and faster. But on the contrary, I was concerned on
                            its negative effects to humankind. It has a potential and features on improving our
                            technology but too much use of this it may surpass human intelligence and it can also be
                            a threat to our education. I am bothered because even today many students use the
                            ChatGpt for cheating as this can create academic writings and it can also solve math
                            problems. Some experts try to test the ChatGpt IQ and according to their findings it
                            achieved a scoring of an average human individual with a general score of 91, and
                            according to inchcalculator.com, most people 68%, have an IQ between 85 to 115, so
                            this ChatGpt can really think just like humans. Improving like this technology may create
                            disturbance to human intelligence but I think if we use it in a right way it lessen its negative
                            impacts to humanity. Afterall, it is still human intelligence will dominate the world. The
                            artificial intelligence may have all the information but it may not replace how human’s
                            creative minds work. The ChatGpt can be our virtual assistant in doing our tasks but
                            remember to not become dependent on this technology as this may reduce our own
                            human intelligence. This was a great invention but always remember what Christian Hans
                            Lounge said, “Technology is a useful servant but a dangerous master”. So, don’t depend
                            your life on this ChatGpt Ai system and always remember to be responsible of your
                            actions. “Think before you Click” the number one rule on the internet to make you safe.
                            Don’t allow Ai exceeds human intelligence remember that the Ai was programmed by
                            humans so we have still the control on it. As a future programmer or developer of software
                            someday, I always think about what technology is beneficial to humans that could make
                            our life and world successful, productive and purposeful.
